## Game Rules
1. The game will randomly select a word.
2. The player will try to guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
3. If the player suggests a letter that is in the word, the letter appears in the correct position(s).
4. If the player suggests a letter that is not in the word, the number of remaining guesses decreases.
5. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of guesses.
